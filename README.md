# App4Mini

This mobile application let's you know if someone ordered something on your website. Also, you see what products are on your website.

Implemented with Java and Codename One.

## Tutorial

To be able to run this app you need to go to your Wordpress admin panel and generate API keys. Here's the tutorial: https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/

Now you can login with your shopname and the two keys.

Voil√†!
